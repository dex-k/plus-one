This website was made for a high-school assessment task in 2017, when I was in Year 9. I 
thought I had uploaded it to GitHub at the time, but it turns out all the (relevant) 
files were empty. In August 2023 I dug back through archives to find the original files. Don't 
judge it too harshly lol, this code reflects a 15 year old me.
